Along with my team we are building this app.<br>


## Getting Started<br>
Let's talk about this app, So I think many of sometimes tried to track our progess or our growth in a certain topic,
after few days of tracking we lost our data or somehwo discontinue the process and we lost the tracking of our improvement.
So me and my team came up with this idea that, lets do something for this. Let's build something that can help us to keep track of our data.
So we came up with **UPWARDS** an app that keep track of your habits, like sleeping, physical exercise, study time , and food consumption.
**What we can do with this app:**<br>
1.Track Sleeping <br>
2.Track calorie burn in exercise<br>
3.Track Study Hour<br>
4.Track Food Consumption<br>
and with the help of a **SmartWatch** you can connect with this app and keep track of:<br>

1.Heart Rate Monitoring<br>
2.Step Count<br>
3.Stress Level<br>
